# CrusadeTome

A 'Crusade' mode roster tracker for Warhammer40k 9th edition. (Currently under
active development)

## Description

**CrusadeTome** is a standalone program used in conjunction with the 'Crusade' rules
of Warhammer 40k. This program will allow you to do the following:
* Create a roster for your desired faction, with the most current unit data available
* Add and remove units, as well as track their requisitions and battle scars
* Track your roster's progress through your faction's campaign, as well as any requisitions
* Import and export your list to JSON; share your lists with other people

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

CrusadeTome requires PyQt5, available through the ```pip``` installer.

```pip3 install PyQt5```

### Executing program

### Installing

* Currently a work in progress, the UI is launchable by running main.py.

## Help

Currently an in-progress program, the UI is mostly inoperable. Please be
patient, as CrusadeTome is under active development and will eventually be
launchable as a standalone executable program.

And yes, once 10th edition comes out, the program will be updated to the new
Crusade rules.
